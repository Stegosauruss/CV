## Profile

After a successful career teaching others, I decided it was time for some learning myself and signed up to Makers Academy's developer bootcamp. Since then I have been hard at work writing well factored code which has practical applications.

#### Key Skills
- Python, Django, DjangoCms, Unittest
- JavaScript, Typescript, React, Angular, Ionic, jQuery
- Ruby, Rails, RSpec, Sinatra
- Travis CI, Codeship, Heroku, Git, Html, CSS
- Agile and XP values
- Strong TDD and Debugging process
- A Quick Study, Persistent and Determined


## Principles

#### Continuous Development
I love working in tech. Every day I become a stronger dev but the scale of what I don't know becomes clearer as well. New developments mean opportunities to grow are never-ending. I have attended meet-ups and lectures on topics such as chat-bots and AI. I feel that with enough time and support I can tackle any problem set in front of me, the harder the challenge the stronger I will be at the end of it.

#### SOLID
I like to build beautiful and readable code. It's important to me that when someone looks at my work I can feel proud of what I have created. I enjoy practicing tech tests to hone these skills. Currently I participating in [Advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/).

#### Problem Solving
Changing Career from Education to Technology was a big change but problem solving is universal. My experience solving mathematical problems allows me to break down large technical isses into smaller steps. I can visualise the larger picture in order to explain with clarity.


## Experience

**Junior software developer: Housekeep** (November 2019 - Current)
- I was and am thrilled to have been hired by Housekeep shortly after finishing Makers Academy. Working in a smaller team means not only that I needed to step up and contribute from the start but also that I get the chance to work on a diverse portfolio of tickets every sprint.
- Working throughout the Covid crisis, there was a need to respond dynamically to a changing and highly pressured environment. This time has made me a stronger developer and professional.
- As a result of my strong work I have been given charge of a major objective from the company. This has provided me with opportunities to consider product decisions and priorities along with the best way to deliver them through code.

**The FitzWimarc School** (July 2010 to August 2019) 
*Teacher: Mathematics*
- Ability to produce engaging presentations to varied groups.
- Educated students from ages 11-18 but was more commonly given the important GCSE and A Level classes.
- Due to consistently good teaching practice I was chosen to mentor 5 different student teachers.
- A Deep understanding of how to learn as well as how to share my understanding with others.
- Empathy towards the diverse backgrounds of those I was educating.

**Key Stage 4 Coordinator: Mathematics** (April 2015 to August 2019)
- My school recognised a talent in people management in me and so I was promoted to a middle management position.
- Responsible for Mathematics GCSE results for the whole school.
- Overseeing the change into the new 9-1 syllabus, it was necessary for me to adapt departmental practice as well as share our findings with the rest of the school.
- Organisation and delivery of staff meetings
- Ran performance reviews of my department as well as day to day management to ensure they met their review targets.
