## Profile

After being a mathematics teacher for 10 years, it was time for a new challenge so I signed up to a software engineer bootcamp. I thrived studying at Makers Academy, particularly during tech tests and while working collaboratively in group projects. Now I'm eager to jump to the next stage by participating in building larger scale commercial products.

#### Key Skills
- JavaScript/React
- Rails/Ruby
- Agile and XP values
- Strong TDD and Debugging process
- A Quick Study, Persistent and Determined

## Projects

Happy Chappy | Happy Chappy is a mood check-in app where you can chat to like-minded people. It incorporates a simple chat bot and conversation channels based on your mood. | React, Rails, Heroku, Travis CI, ActionCable | I ran morning tutorials or run throughs to keep everyone up to date on the project and technologies. | [Blog](https://medium.com/happy-chappy-dev-blog), [GitHub](https://github.com/Stegosauruss/HappyChappy)
Acebook: Fantastic 4 | 4 Training Developers team up to improve teamwork as well as build their own version of facebook | Rails, Heroku, Travis CI, Rubocop, Codeclimate | Developed strong Agile practices from my team members as well as an understanding of my own role and in a small team. | [Blog](https://medium.com/fantastic-four-acebook-project), [GitHub](https://github.com/Stegosauruss/acebook-fantastic-four)
News Summary Challenge | A news summary web app, the challenge: No Libraries allowed! | JavaScript, Guardian API, Javascript, My own testing suite: Lemons or Lemonade | Limitations can lead to some of the most interesting approaches. I loved the challenge of building my own testing environment. | [GitHub](https://github.com/Stegosauruss/news-summary-challenge)


## Skills

#### Continuous Development
I love working in tech. Every day I become a stronger dev but the scale of what I don't know becomes clearer as well. In tech, opportunities to grow are never ending. I have attended meet-ups and lectures on topics such as chat-bots and AI and I'm always keen to incorporate these into my own work.
[I recently tracked my learning at Makers Academy via a daily blog.](https://medium.com/@russell.wind). 

#### SOLID principles
I like to build beautiful and readable code. It's important to me that when someone looks at my work I can feel proud of what I have created. I enjoy practicing tech tests to hone these skills.

#### Problem Solving
Changing Career from Education to Technology was a big change but problem solving is universal. My experience solving mathematical problems allows me to break down large technical isses into smaller steps. I can visualise the larger picture in order to explain with clarity.
