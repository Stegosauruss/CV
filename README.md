I have been a working teacher for the last 10 years. I feel this gives me a varied skillset as well as an ability to learn and share ideas.

#### National Professional Qualification for Middle Leaders (Anglia Ruskin University)

This qualification gave me time to consider the best ways to gain the most from colleagues. It taught me that this is not a one size fits all approach and that in order to manage a team well you have to understand how those individuals operate and use the appropriate strategy.
