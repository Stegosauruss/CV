## Profile

After being a teacher for 10 years I was desperate for a new challenge and have found it in tech. Although I have loved developing my skills at Makers Academy, I'm desperate to learn more by working on bigger projects.

#### Key Skills
- JavaScript/React
- Rails/Ruby
- Agile and XP values.
- Strong TDD and Debugging process.
- A quick study with a dogged mindset.

## Skills

#### Constant Development
I love working in tech. Every day I become a stronger dev but the scale of what I don't know becomes clearer as well. In tech opportunities to grow are never ending. I have attended meet-ups and lectures on topics such as chat-bots and AI and I'm always keen to incorporate these into my own work.

#### SOLID as a rock
I like to build beautiful and readable code. It's important to me that when someone looks at my work I can feel proud of what I have created. I enjoy practicing tech tests to hone these skills.

#### No Problem too large
It was a big change from Education to Tech but problem solving is universal. By taking a step back and trying to visualise the problem, even large technical issues can be broken down into smaller steps and solved just like a tricky maths question.
